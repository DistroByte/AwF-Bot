# AwF-Bot
This bot is for integration of a Discord server and multiple Factorio servers. It has been programmed tailored to fit [All-Weekend Factorio](awf.yt), but with minor changes, it could probably be fit to your Factorio server(s) too!

## `serversetup.py`
When run, `serversetup.py` will give a choice of which server to reset. It will copy the latest game save to the user specified folder, a directory above. The saves can then be synced with a program such as MegaSync into a shared directory, so players can download the saves if they want to continue with them.
