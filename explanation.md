# Explanation of AwF-Bot
The AwF Bot is a Discord bot for the [AwF community](http://awf.yt), a community of passionate Factorio players. It is intended for players and moderators at once (though this may change later).

# Important features
## Anti-griefing protection
This bot has auto-griefing protection. If someone sends `?griefer` from a Discord channel or Factorio servers, moderators and admins will be pinged to go and quickly resolve the issue.
The scenario that we run on *most* servers has player roles, Member, Veteran, Supporter, Moderator, Admin etc. These are used for different permission levels. If you believe that someone is griefing and you have the Veteran role, you can use the `?griefer` command, however, you can **also jail the player** with `/jail <playerName>` in-game. This will prevent them from committing any more destruction by not allowing them to do anything except for typing into chat.
## Player linking
There exists tight integration with the [AwF-Scenario](https://github.com/oof2win2/AwF-Scenario). Player linking is an important feature for moderators and other players to know who you are. It gives you the role Member and allows you to collect points for statistics, but also some in-game perks. Allows for recieving further roles.
## Scenario features
This is a brief explanation of the [AwF-Scenario](https://github.com/oof2win2/AwF-Scenario)'s features. If you are linked and have over 10h collectively, you automatically get the Veteran role, which is useful for preventing griefers and some other perks.
In the scenario, mass-deconstruction (decon planner) is disabled unless you have the Member role or higher, for which player linking is required.
